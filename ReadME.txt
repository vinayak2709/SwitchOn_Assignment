This project is about Detection process and Saving in the No SQL database and 
simultaneously display detection video and Detection status.

This project is just basic level just to give idea about implementation.Advance level mongoDB concepts, Daily automated emails, CSv export and also UI can be enhanced by using HTML css.Azure hhtp triggers can be used for dashboard.
Instead of just 100 images whole continuous video can be monitored in the project (many continuous frames) and also Camera is needed.Saving lot of images is huge data/memory consuming activity but can be done if required.(by "fourcc", videowrite in opnCv itself)
